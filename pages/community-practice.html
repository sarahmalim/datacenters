<h2 id="community-practice">DCOI Community of Practice</h2>

<p>Agencies can participate in a forum to collaborate on their data center optimization strategies and to discuss topics, including OMB reporting best practices, data center infrastructure management, and shared services marketplace participation.</p>

<p>The COP will hold meetings the first Wednesday of each month at The GSA building in downtown Washington, D.C (the 1800 F Street location) from 10:30am -12:00pm.</p>

<p>Join the Data Center's listserv to be updated on CoP opportunities by emailing listserv@listserv.gsa.gov with no subject and "subscribe datacenters" in the body of the message.</p>
